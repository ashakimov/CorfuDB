/**
 * This SMR engine is identical to the OneShot, except after a OneShot's one-time use,
 * this SMR engine can be reused, starting at its previously synced location. This is to enable
 * caching of SMR engines that are created during DeferredTxns.
 *
 * Write commands are reflected immediately on the object (for TX support)
 * and not written to the log. They are also buffered, so that the commands can be collected and inserted into the
 * hint section of the Logging Units.
 *
 * So you should NEVER, EVER, use this engine unless you are IMPLEMENTING
 * TRANSACTIONS.
